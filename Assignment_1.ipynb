    "An expression in programming is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that, when evaluated, produces a resulting value. Expressions are used to perform calculations, compare values, manipulate data, and more.Here's what expressions are typically made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Values and Variables: These are the fundamental building blocks of expressions. Values can be literals like numbers or strings, while variables hold values that can change during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Operators: Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more values or variables. They dictate how the values are combined or manipulated. Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), etc.\n",

For example, in an if statement, the expression within the parentheses determines whether the following code block should be executed.

Expressions themselves do not usually cause side effects or change the state of the program.A statement is a complete unit of code that performs an action or a series of actions.ex 2 + 3\n",
